# Getting started

Everything inside of the RubberHose system is designed specifically to never need a manual. This is the manual that you will hopefully never need. 

## Tutorial project

Get up and running as fast as possible by downloading the [RubberHose Tutorial Project](). It's a hands-on walkthrough of all the main features inside of the system. 

Note: the tutorial project requires RubberHose 2 to be installed.
